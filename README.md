# Fraud Detection in Credit Card Transactions

## Overview

In this project, we will consolidate our machine learning (ML) modeling skills by using two popular classification models to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions. These models are: Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine. We will use a real dataset to train each of these models. The dataset includes information about transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. We will use the trained model to assess if a credit card transaction is legitimate or not.

## Approach

1. **Import Libraries**: We will import the necessary libraries for data analysis, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

2. **Dataset Analysis**: We will analyze the dataset to understand its structure, features, and distribution of classes.

3. **Dataset Preprocessing**: We will preprocess the dataset, which may include handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.

4. **Dataset Train/Test Split**: We will split the dataset into training and testing sets to train the models and evaluate their performance.

5. **Build a Decision Tree Classifier model with Scikit-Learn**: We will train a Decision Tree Classifier model using the Scikit-Learn library.

6. **Build a Decision Tree Classifier model with Snap ML**: We will train a Decision Tree Classifier model using the Snap Machine Learning (Snap ML) library, which provides highly-efficient CPU/GPU implementations of ML algorithms.

7. **Evaluate the Scikit-Learn and Snap ML Decision Tree Classifiers**: We will evaluate the performance of the Decision Tree Classifier models trained using both Scikit-Learn and Snap ML.

8. **Build a Support Vector Machine model with Scikit-Learn**: We will train a Support Vector Machine model using the Scikit-Learn library.

9. **Build a Support Vector Machine model with Snap ML**: We will train a Support Vector Machine model using the Snap ML library.

10. **Evaluate the Scikit-Learn and Snap ML Support Vector Machine Models**: We will evaluate the performance of the Support Vector Machine models trained using both Scikit-Learn and Snap ML.
